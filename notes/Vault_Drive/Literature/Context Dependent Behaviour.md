# Context Dependent Behaviour

**Summary**: How do neuronal population code representations that supports context-dependent behaviour? Specially when the two context uses same input signals dimension, in order to produce task-relevant behaviour higher-order decision making areas have to read-out input signals in different manner based on the context. Current paper questions that whether task-context pre-configure brain areas/regions/neuronal population such that when input signals reach to these areas, task-relevant representations get automatically encoded to ease the decision making process.

**Summary**: This paper talks about how neuronal population (specially in PFC) encodes multiple task contexts and based on the task-context downstream neurons to these PFC neurons read-out in task-specific manner.
