For Figure 6:
Wg is scaled up (2x).
Grating change detection simulated microstim experiments:
	a) Focal micro-stimulation is *simulated by scaling up (1.1x) the recurrent and output weights of mnemonic coding st-RNN units at each, respective microstimulated location*.
	b) Quantifying focal micro-stimulation: Show miss and FA rate for responses to location A as the function of change angle.
